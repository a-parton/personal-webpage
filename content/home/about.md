# Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate of statistical ecology in the department of [Animal and Plant Sciences](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps) at the University of Sheffield, working with [Dr Dylan Childs](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps/staff-and-students/acadstaff/childs) and [Prof Paul Blackwell](http://paul-blackwell.staff.shef.ac.uk/) and funded by the Leverhulme Trust.

Currently, I am working on applying ABC methodologies to a dynamic energy budget model for the Soay sheep population. My PhD involved developing continuous-time statistical models for carrying out inference on animal movement data obtained by GPS telemetry.
